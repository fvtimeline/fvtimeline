Both of these accounts support a move to Palmyra in 1816.<br>\n<br>\nSince Joseph indicates that his family moved to Manchester about four years after they arrived in Palmyra, and the religious excitement preceeding the First Vision (<a href=\"http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/history-1838-1856-volume-a-1-23-december-1805-30-august-1834\" target=\"_tab\">which he dates to 1820</a>) began in the second year after their removal to Manchester, we would have to assume that the 1815 date (if not earlier) is when he recollects that his family's move to Palmyra occurred."

This list was created in April of each year. We find Joseph Smith Sr.'s name on this list in district 26 from 1817 to 1822, consistent with his arrival in the latter part of 1816. Road District 26 began in the center of Palmyra on Main Street and included a road heading south toward Farmington (later known as Manchester). The road tax list was made each year in April by heading west on Main Street and then south toward Farmington. (Palmyra, NY, \"Record of Roads of the Town of Palmyra, 1793-1901,\" 94-95, 104)<br>\n<br>\nWhen the Smiths first moved to Palmyra, they lived in a home built by Samuel Jennings on the west end of Main Street, which is consistent with Joseph Smith Sr.'s name being close to the middle of the road tax list from 1817-19. In 1820, we see Alvin Smith's name for the first time. It appears that Alvin was still using the Main Street home, while Joseph Smith Sr. had moved from this home to somewhere south of Main Street as his name is separate from Alvin's and appears at the bottom of the road tax list in 1820 and 1821. This is consistent with the <a href=\"http://www.palmyrany.com/minutes/TB/1820.pdf\" target=\"_tab\">Palmyra Town Book of 1820</a>, which places \"Joseph Smith's dwelling house\" about 50 feet north of the town line between Palmyra and Farmington (as recorded on 13 June 1820). <a href=\"http://www.lds.org/ensign/1985/08/archaeological-work-at-the-smith-log-house\" target=\"_tab\">An excavation on this site</a> in 1982 showed that there indeed was a structure dating to the time of the Smiths' time there. This cabin was on land owned by Samuel Jennings, a merchant who built and owned the Smith's Main Street home and with whom the Smiths did business.<br>\n<br>\nIt was likely in this cabin where Lucy Smith, daughter of Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith, was born. Joseph Smith's 1834-1836 history <a href=\"http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/history-1834-1836?p=12\" target=\"_tab\">gives a genealogy of his family</a> that gives Lucy's birth date and place: \"Lucy Smith, born in Palmyra, Ontario Co.

        "text": "The land the Smiths bought in Farmington (later Manchester) was owned by the heirs of Nicholas Evertson, a New York City attorney who passed away in 1807. The Evertson heirs gave power of attorney to Caspar W. Eddy to sell a 300 acre parcel they owned on the Farmington/Palmyra town line. <a href=\"http://www.fullerconsideration.com/images/Power_of_Attorney.png\" target=\"_tab\">Eddy transferred the power of attorney</a> to Zachariah Seymour, a land agent in nearby Canandaigua, on 14 July 1820. This paved the way for the land to be sold to the Smiths. On 7 July 1821, the <a href=\"http://www.fullerconsideration.com/images/Manchester%20Assessment%20Roll%201821-1823.pdf\" target=\"_tab\">Manchester Assessment Roll</a> shows the Evertson heirs were taxed for 200 of the acres, while the Smiths were taxed for the remaining 100, indicating that the Smiths had begun contracting for the land sometime between 14 July 1820 and 7 July 1821.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/lucy-mack-smith-history-1844-1845?p=37\" target=\"_tab\">Lucy reports in her autobiograpy</a>, \"In one year's time we made nearly all of the first payment. The Agent advised us to build a log house on the land and commence clearing it, we did so. It was not long till we had 30 acres ready for cultivation. But the second payment was now coming due and no means as yet of meeting it.\" The Manchester Assessment Roll shows us that on 29 June 1822, the Smith's land was assessed at $700, as it was the year prior. On 24 July 1823, the value of the land increased to $1000, indicating the Smiths had cleared a portion of their land and finished building a log cabin as Lucy stated. If the Smiths contracted for the land soon after Zachariah Seymour received the power of attorney to sell it, around August of 1820, then the rest of the first payment and all of the second payment would have been paid to Seymour by August of 1821. Lucy adds that they were unable to make the third and last payment (which would have been approximately August of 1822) because the land agent died. <a href=\"http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=37225604\" target=\"_tab\">Seymour did indeed die on 2 July 1822</a>, corroborating this part of her story and establishing the fact that the Smiths contracted for the land sometime after mid-July 1820. This would place their move onto the Manchester farm sometime between 29 June 1822 and 24 July 1823.<br>\n<br>\nTo further narrow the date of the move onto the farm in Manchester, <a href=\"http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/lucy-mack-smith-history-1844-1845?dm=image-and-text&p=39\" target=\"_tab\">Lucy mentions</a> that \"in the Spring after we moved onto the farm\" they began making preparations to build their frame house. She shortly thereafter tells the story of Joseph having his first vision of Moroni, which is dated to September of 1823. If the Spring of 1823 was the Spring after they moved onto the farm, the move must have happened between 29 June 1822 and Spring of 1823. It seems likely that the Smiths moved onto their Manchester farm near the time they would have made their final payment in the summer of 1822, which was shortly after the death of Zachariah Seymour, as they were able to use this money to build their frame house <a href=\"http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/lucy-mack-smith-history-1844-1845?\np=45\" target=\"_tab\">which was raised in November of 1823</a>, shortly before Alvin Smith died."

He relates, \"In the month of June, 1827, Joseph Smith, Sen., related to me the following story: 'That some years ago, a spirit had appeared to Joseph his son, in a vision, and informed him that in a certain place there was a record on plates of gold, and that he was the person that must obtain them, and this he must do in the following manner: On the 22d of September, he must repair to the place where was deposited this manuscript, dressed in black clothes, and riding a black horse with a switch tail, and demand the book in a certain name, and after obtaining it, he must go directly away, and neither lay it down nor look behind him.'\"<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/latterdaysaintsm01unse#page/78/mode/2up\" target=\"_tab\">Oliver Cowdery's correspondence with W. W. Phelps</a>, published in the Messenger and Advocate in 1835, gives us the exact date: \"On the evening of the 21st of September, 1823, previous to retiring to rest, our brother's mind was unusually wrought up on the subject which had so long agitated his mind-his heart was drawn out in fervent prayer ... While continuing in prayer for a manifestation in some way that his sins were forgiven; endeavoring to exercise faith in the scriptures, on a sudden a light like that of day, only of a purer and far more glorious appearance and brightness, burst into the room ... and in a moment a personage stood before him. ...  He ... gave a history of the aborigines of this country, and said they were literal descendants of Abraham. He represented them as once being an enlightened and intelligent people, possessing a cerrect [correct] knowledge of the gospel, and the plan of restoration and redemption. He said this history was written and deposited not far from that place, and that it was our brother's privilege, if obedient to the commandments of the Lord, to obtain, and translate the same by the means of the Urim and Thummim, which were deposited for that purpose with the record.\""

It may be added, that in Palmyra and Macedon, including Methodist, Presbyterian and Baptist Churches, more than 400 have already testified that the Lord is good.\" Other mentions of the revival can be found in the New York Religious Chronicle 2 (November 20, 1824): 154; 3 (April 9, 1825): 58; Western New York Baptist Magazine 4 (February 1825): 284; Western Recorder 1 (November 9, 1824): 90; 2 (March 29, 1825): 50; Boston Recorder 10 (April 29, 1825): 70; 10 (May 20, 1825): 82; Baptist Register (Utica), December 3, 1824; March 11, 1825, 7; American Baptist, February 1825; Zion's Herald 3 (February 9, May 11, 1825), a Methodist weekly in Boston; American Baptist Magazine 5 (April 1825): 124-25; and the New York Observer, May 7, 1825 (The Rise of Mormonism, H.

I was at this time in my fifteenth year. My Fathers family were proselyted to the Presbyterian faith and four of them joined that Church, Namely, My Mother Lucy, My Brothers Hyrum, Samuel Harrison, and my Sister Soph[r]onia. ... While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, First Chapter and fifth verse which reads, 'If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.' Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man that this did at this time to mine. I at last came to the determination to ask of God, concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally and not upbraid, I might venture. After I had retired into the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God, I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was siezed upon by some power which entirely overcame me and had such astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction. But exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had siezed upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction, not to an im aginary ruin but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world who had such a marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being. Just at this moment of great alarm I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head above the brightness of the sun, which descended gracefully gradually untill it fell upon me. It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two personages (whose brightness and glory defy all description) standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me calling me by name and said (pointing to the other) 'This is my beloved Son, Hear him.' My object in going to enquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner therefore did I get possession of myself so as to be able to speak, than I asked the personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right, (for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong) and which I should join. I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong, and the Personage who addressed me said that all their Creeds were an abomination in his sight, that those professors were all corrupt, that \u201cthey draw near to me to with their lips but their hearts are far from me, They teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of Godliness but they deny the power thereof.\u201d He again forbade me to join with any of them and many other thing[s] did he say unto me which I cannot write at this time. I soon found however that my telling the story had excited a great deal of prejudice against me among professors of religion and was the cause of great persecution which continued to increase and though I was an obscure boy only between fourteen and fifteen years of age or thereabouts, and my circumstances in life such as to make a boy of no consequence in the world, Yet men of high standing would take notice sufficiently to excite the public mind against me and create a hot per secution, and this was common among all the sects: all united to persecute me. It has often caused me serious reflection both then and since, how very strange it was that an obscure boy of a little over fourteen years of age and one too who was doomed to the necessity of obtaining a scanty maintainance by his daily labor should be thought a character of sufficient importance to attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular sects of the day so as to create in them a spirit of the bitterest persecution and reviling. But strange or not, so it was, and was often cause of great sorrow to myself. However it was  nevertheless a fact, that I had had a Vision."

        "headline": "An Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions by Orson Pratt",
        "tag": "Other",
        "text": "Orson Pratt was an early convert to the church and one of the original twelve apostles called by Joseph Smith. In 1839, while preparing for a proselyting mission to the British Isles, Pratt had the opportunity to travel with Joseph Smith in the eastern states while Joseph was seeking redress from the United States government for the church's losses in Missouri. During this period, Pratt attended speeches given by Joseph, thus leaving the recollections of Joseph's early visions fresh in his mind. In 1840, he published a pamphlet called \"<a href=\"http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/appendix-orson-pratt-an-interesting-account-of-several-remarkable-visions-1840?p=3\" target=\"_tab\">An Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions</a>\". It begins with an account of Joseph's first vision:<br>\n<br>\nWhen somewhere about fourteen or fifteen years old, he began seriously to reflect upon the necessity of being prepared for a future state of existence: but how, or in what way, to prepare himself, was a question, as yet, undetermined in his own mind: he perceived that it was a question of infinite importance, and that the salvation of his soul depended upon a correct understanding of the same. He saw, that if he understood not the way, it would be impossible to walk in it, except by chance; and the thought of resting his hopes of eternal life upon chance, or uncertainties, was more than he could endure. If he went to the religious denominations to seek information, each one pointed to its particular tenets, saying- \"This is the way, walk ye in it;\" while, at the same time, the doctrines of each were, in many respects, in direct opposition to one another. It, also, occurred to his mind, that God was not the author of but one doctrine, and therefore could not acknowledge but one denomination as his church; and that such denomination must be a people, who believe, and teach, that one doctrine, (whatever it may be,) and build upon the same. He then reflected upon the immense number of doctrines, now, in the world, which had given rise to many hundreds of different denominations. The great question to be decided in his mind, was-if any one of these denominations be the Church of Christ, which one is it? Until he could become satisfied, in relation to this question, he could not rest contented. To trust to the decisions of fallible man, and build his hopes upon the same, without any certainty, and knowledge, of his own, would not satisfy the anxious desires that pervaded his breast. To decide, without any positive and definite evidence, on which he could rely, upon a subject involving the future welfare of his soul, was revolting to his feelings. The only alternative, that seemed to be left him, was to read the Scriptures, and endeavour to follow their directions. He, accordingly, commenced perusing the sacred pages of the Bible, with sincerity, believing the things that he read. His mind soon caught hold of the following passage:-\"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\"-James i. 5. From this promise he learned, that it was the privilege of all men to ask God for wisdom, with the sure and certain expectation of receiving, liberally; without being upbraided for so doing. This was cheering information to him: tidings that gave him great joy. It was like a light shining forth in a dark place, to guide him to the path in which he should walk. He, now, saw that if he inquired of God, there was, not only, a possibility, but a probability; yea, more, a certainty, that he should obtain a knowledge, which, of all the doctrines, was the doctrine of Christ; and, which, of all the churches, was the church of Christ. He, therefore, retired to a secret place, in a grove, but a short distance from his father's house, and knelt down, and began to call upon the Lord. At first, he was severely tempted by the powers of darkness, which endeavoured to overcome him; but he continued to seek for deliverance, until darkness gave way from his mind; and he was enabled to pray, in fervency of the spirit, and in faith. And, while thus pouring out his soul, anxiously desiring an answer from God, he, at length, saw a very bright and glorious light in the heavens above; which, at first, seemed to be at a considerable distance. He continued praying, while the light appeared to be gradually descending towards him; and, as it drew nearer, it increased in brightness, and magnitude, so that, by the time that it reached the tops of the trees, the whole wilderness, for some distance around, was illuminated in a most glorious and brilliant manner. He expected to have seen the leaves and boughs of the trees consumed, as soon as the light came in contact with them; but, perceiving that it did not produce that effect, he was encouraged with the hopes of being able to endure its presence. It continued descending, slowly, until it rested upon the earth, and he was enveloped in the midst of it. When it first came upon him, it produced a peculiar sensation throughout his whole system; and, immediately, his mind was caught away, from the natural objects with which he was surrounded; and he was enwrapped in a heavenly vision, and saw two glorious personages, who exactly resembled each other in their features or likeness. He was informed, that his sins were forgiven. He was also informed upon the subjects, which had for some time previously agitated his mind, viz.-that all the religious denominations were believing in incorrect doctrines; and, consequently, that none of them was acknowledged of God, as his church and kingdom. And he was expressly commanded, to go not after them; and he received a promise that the true doctrine- the fulness of the gospel, should, at some future time, be made known to him; after which, the vision withdrew, leaving his mind in a state of calmness and peace, indescribable.",

Believing the word of God I had confidence in the declaration of James; \u201cIf any man lack wisdom let him ask of God who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him,\u201d I retired to a secret place in a grove and began to call upon the Lord, while fervently engaged in supplication my mind was taken away from the objects with which I was surrounded, and I was enwrapped in a heavenly vision and saw two glorious personages who exactly resembled each other in features, and likeness, surrounded with a brilliant light which eclipsed the sun at noon-day.

An excerpt from <a href=\"http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/orson-hyde-ein-ruf-aus-der-wste-a-cry-out-of-the-wilderness-1842-extract-english-translation\" target=\"_tab\">the English translation</a> follows:<br>\n<br>\n\"When he had reached his fifteenth year, he began to think seriously about the importance of preparing for a future [existence]; but it was very difficult for him to decide how he should go about such an important undertaking. He recognized clearly that it would be impossible for him to walk the proper path without being acquainted with it beforehand; and to base his hopes for eternal life on chance or blind uncertainty would have been more than he had ever been inclined to do.<br>\n<br>\nHe discovered the world of religion working under a flood of errors which by virtue of their contradictory opinions and principles laid the foundation for the rise of such different sects and denominations whose feelings toward each other all too often were poisoned by hate, contention, resentment and anger. He felt that there was only one truth and that those who understood it correctly, all understood it in the same way. Nature had endowed him with a keen critical intellect and so he looked through the lens of reason and common sense and with pity and contempt upon those systems of religion, which were so opposed to each other and yet were all obviously based on the scriptures.<br>\n<br>\nAfter he had sufficiently convinced himself to his own satisfaction that darkness covered the earth and gross darkness [covered] the nations, the hope of ever finding a sect or denomination that was in possession of unadulterated truth left him.<br>\n<br>\nConsequently he began in an attitude of faith his own investigation of the word of God [feeling that it was] the best way to arrive at a knowledge of the truth. He had not proceeded very far in this laudable endeavor when his eyes fell upon the following verse of St. James [1:5]: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\" He considered this scripture an authorization for him to solemnly call upon his creator to present his needs before him with the certain expectation of some success. And so he began to pour out to the Lord with fervent determination the earnest desires of his soul. On one occasion, he went to a small grove of trees near his father's home and knelt down before God in solemn prayer. The adversary then made several strenuous efforts to cool his ardent soul. He filled his mind with doubts and brought to mind all manner of inappropriate images to prevent him from obtaining the object of his endeavors; but the overflowing mercy of God came to buoy him up and gave new impetus to his failing strength. However, the dark cloud soon parted and light and peace filled his frightened heart. Once again he called upon the Lord with faith and fervency of spirit.<br>\n<br>\nAt this sacred moment, the natural world around him was excluded from his view, so that he would be open to the presentation of heavenly and spiritual things. Two glorious heavenly personages stood before him, resembling each other exactly in features and stature. They told him that his prayers had been answered and that the Lord had decided to grant him a special blessing. He was also told that he should not join any of the religious sects or denominations, because all of them erred in doctrine and none was recognized by God as his church and kingdom. He was further commanded, to wait patiently until some future time, when the true doctrine of Christ and the complete truth of the gospel would be revealed to him. The vision closed and peace and calm filled his mind.\"",

He conversed with Joseph for over an hour, during which he heard Joseph <a href=\"http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/PA/penn1842.htm#091543\" target=\"_tab\">describe his first vision</a>:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... The Lord does reveal himself to me. I know it. He revealed himself to me first when I was about fourteen years old, a mere boy. I will tell you about it. There was a reformation among the different religious denominations in the neighborhood where I lived, and I became serious, and was desirous to know what church to join.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile thinking of this matter, I opened the testament promiscuously on these words, in James, 'Ask of the Lord who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not.' -- I just determined I'd ask him. I immediately went out into the woods where my father had a clearing, and went to the stump, where I had stuck my axe when I had quit work, and I kneeled down, and prayed, saying, 'O Lord, what church shall I join?' Directly I saw a light, and then a glorious personage in the light, and then another personage, and the first personage said to the second, 'Behold my beloved son, hear him.' I then, addressed this second person, saying, 'O Lord, what church shall I join?' He replied, 'don't join any of them, they are all corrupt.' The vision then vanished, and when I came to myself, I was sprawling on my back; and it was some time before my strength returned. When I went home and told the people that I had a revelation, and that all the churches were corrupt, they persecuted me, and they have persecuted me ever since. They thought to put me down, but they haven't succeeded, and they can't do it.\"",

Each system claimed its right and power to give belief and hope, but none to communicate knowledge of its divine Authority. In comparing them one with another there seemed too much confusion, the same also appeared in looking at each separately: - turning therefore from these clashing systems, and having been encouraged, and inspired with the following passage in St. James 'If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God;' he retired to a grove, a little distance from his father's, and in fervent prayer besought the Lord to communicate with him, and reveal the way of salvation. While thus engaged a light brilliant and glorious appeared in the heavens gradually descending towards him till he was enveloped in its power, and wrapped in celestial vision; when he beheld two glorious beings similar in dress and appearance who informed him that the religious sects had all departed from the ancient doctrine of the apostles, and that the Gospel, with its gifts and blessings should be made known to him at a future period. Many important things were manifested in this vision which the brevity of this work will not admit our noticing.\"",

      <div class="question">What is the purpose of this website?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        The purpose of this website is to accurately document the history surrounding the first vision of Joseph Smith Jr., in which he claimed to have been visited by two personages identified as God the Father and his son Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith's narrative is compared with contemporary evidence on parallel timelines in order to better understand the true history of this event. We are committed to accurately documenting this history given the sources available to us. As such, we welcome any corrections or criticisms so that we can improve our accuracy.
      </div>

      <div class="question">Why is this history important?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        The First Vision of Joseph Smith is one of the foundational claims of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We feel it is important to fully understand the circumstances and events surrounding such an important event. President Gordon B. Hinckley said of the First Vision:<br>
        <br>
        "Our whole strength rests on the validity of that vision. It either occurred or it did not occur. If it did not, then this work is a fraud ... upon that unique and wonderful experience stands the validity of this church" (The Marvelous Foundation of our Faith," Ensign, November 2002, 80.)
