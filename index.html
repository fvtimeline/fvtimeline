      <div class="question">What is the purpose of this website?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        The purpose of this website is to accurately document the history surrounding the first vision of Joseph Smith Jr., in which he claimed to have been visited by two personages identified as God the Father and his son Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith's narrative is compared with contemporary evidence on parallel timelines in order to better understand the true history of this event.

      <div class="question">Is this site anti-Mormon?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        This site is not intended to attack or belittle the beliefs of faithful Mormons. The historical record in some places does not completely agree with the accounts Joseph Smith gave of his first vision. That being the case, some believers may find some of this information threatening to their belief, but that is certainly not the goal of the site. In no way do we believe that accurate history should ever be considered anti-Mormon.
