      <div class="question">What is the purpose of this website?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        The purpose of this website is to accurately document the history surrounding the first vision of Joseph Smith Jr., in which he claimed to have been visited by two personages identified as God the Father and his son Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith's narrative is compared with contemporary evidence on parallel timelines in order to better understand the true history of this event. We are committed to accurately documenting this history given the sources available to us. As such, we welcome any corrections or criticisms so that we can improve our accuracy.

      <div class="question">Why is this history important?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        The First Vision of Joseph Smith is one of the foundational claims of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We feel it is important to fully understand the circumstances and events surrounding such an important event. President Gordon B. Hinckley said of the First Vision:<br>
        <br>
        "Our whole strength rests on the validity of that vision. It either occurred or it did not occur. If it did not, then this work is a fraud ... upon that unique and wonderful experience stands the validity of this church" (The Marvelous Foundation of our Faith," Ensign, November 2002, 80.)
